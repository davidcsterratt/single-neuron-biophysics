    "The voltage first settles to −70 mV (the resting membrane potential) from its starting value of −65 mV. Then, at 100 ms (the time of the current\n",
    "injection onset), it starts to rise, though not instantaneously. This is because when current is injected it will first mainly charge the membrane capacitance, but as this charges up, more of it will flow through\n",
    "the membrane resistance. It levels out at about −63.65 mV. In this steady state, all the current flows\n",
    "through the membrane resistance rather than onto the membrane capacitance.\n",
    "At 200 ms (the time of the current offset) the membrane potential starts to decay back to the resting\n",
    "potential. This is due to the capacitance discharging slowly through the resistance. This is a bit like a\n",
    "battery going flat, though on a much faster timescale!\n",
    "We can check that the simulation is doing what it should be by making measurements of the simulated\n",
    "results and then comparing them to the theoretical values of the same measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The input resistance\n",
    "The input resistance $R_\\text{in}$ is a measure of how much current needs to be injected to increase the membrane\n",
    "potential by a certain amount, and is often measured experimentally. The input resistance is defined\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R_{\\text{in}} = \\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta i_\\text{e}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Delta V$ is a small change in membrane potential due to a small change in injection current $\\Delta i_{\\text{e}}$. In\n",
    "the case of voltage-dependent conductances, the input resistance may vary depending on the holding\n",
    "membrane potential it is measured at. In our case, the conductances are fixed, so the input resistance\n",
    "will not depend on the holding membrane potential and we do not need to make our change in current\n",
    "and membrane potential small."
