    "We are going to write code to simulate how the voltage changes across the membrane of a cell in which there are almost equal concentrations of positive and negative ions on either side, but with a slight excess of positive charges on the inside, which means that the membrane potential $V$ is positive. The cell membrane has a capacitance of 1 picofarad, i.e. $C=1\\times 10^{-12}$F and a resistance of 10 gigaohms, i.e. $R=10\\times10^9\\Omega$.\n",
